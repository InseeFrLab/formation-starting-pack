This tutorial aims to be a practical guide for people developing educational resources in {{< fa brands r-project >}} or `Python` {{< fa brands python >}} and wishing to disseminate them easily through the `SSPCloud`.

To make this possible, a few technical prerequisites are needed - these are outlined in @imp-req.

The aim of this tutorial is to get you started quickly on building educational resources with a __state-of-the-art level of reproducibility__. The next sections explain how to develop educational resources, and how to disseminate them on the SPPCloud. Keep in mind that this tutorial is intended for people developing resources, not for the users of these resources.

## Technical requirements to deploy educational resources

- A minimum level of proficiency in `Git` {{< fa brands git-alt >}} is required to develop and make available online training resources. However, accessing to these resources on the SSPCloud does not require any familiarity with Git.
- [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/) {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}}
the automated report and website builder inherited from `R Markdown`.
- An understanding of the fundamental difference between making resources available for execution on a local computer or on a server like `SSPCloud`. See [`SSPCloud` documentation](https://docs.sspcloud.fr/en/). 
- Some knowledge regarding deployment of resources using `Github Actions` {{< fa brands github >}} is useful. This tutorial gives a few templates but understanding what is happening behind the stage is not in the scope of that tutorial.

# Why share educational resources on SSPCloud?

Sharing educational resources on SSPCloud offers several advantages, particularly for educators and learners working with computational tools like R or Python. Here are the key benefits:

1. **Instant access via a simple link**
SSPCloud allows users to launch pre-configured workspaces through a simple HTTPS link. Doing so, there is no need for any local installation or complex setup: learners can start working immediately, directly in their browser.

2. **Standardized and reproducible environments**
Everyone accesses the same cloud-based environment, including all necessary packages, tools, and datasets. This ensures full consistency across learners, removing issues related to differing operating systems, versions, or missing dependencies.

3. **Scalable computing power**
SSPCloud offers access to robust computational resources that can scale with your needs. From beginner tutorials in Python or R to advanced workflows involving large datasets or machine learning models, the platform can support a wide range of educational use cases.


As outlined in the SSPCloud documentation, it's important to understand that the platform separates code (Git), data (S3), and environment configuration. These components are dynamically combined when launching a compute session.

For training designers, this architecture ensures high reproducibility and fine-grained control over the environment. For users, it eliminates the need to install software, manage system permissions, or configure their local machine—making it easy to jump straight into the tutorial.

# Which materials should be used for trainings?

When designing effective training materials, it's essential to choose formats that actively engage learners and support comprehension. While PDFs, slide decks, and videos are all valuable for delivering content, this guide focuses on interactive environments, which are particularly well-suited for hands-on learning. These environments enable learners to apply concepts immediately, test code in real time, and actively engage with the material—leading to deeper understanding and better long-term retention.

In the sections that follow, we'll begin by comparing various interactive environments based on the programming language they support. Then, we'll walk through how to build and structure them using Quarto.


## Which interactive environment should you use ? 

:::: {.panel-tabset}
## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

`Jupyter` notebooks[^jupyter] offer an interactive interface that allows you to write `Python` code, test it, and see the result below the instruction rather than in a separate console. `Jupyter` notebooks are essential in the fields of data science and education and research because they greatly simplify exploration and experimentation.

They allow you to combine text in `Markdown` format (a lighter markup text format than `HTML` or $\LaTeX$), `Python` code, and `HTML` code for visualizations and animations in a single document.

[^jupyter]: `Jupyter` originated from the `IPython` project, an interactive environment for `Python` developed by Fernando Pérez in 2001. In 2014, the project evolved to support other programming languages in addition to Python, leading to the creation of the Jupyter project. The name "Jupyter" is an acronym referring to the three main languages it supports: `Julia`, `Python`, and `R`.

Initially, `Jupyter` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-jupyter >}} was the only software offering these interactive features. Now, there are other ways to benefit from notebook advantages while having an IDE with more comprehensive features than `Jupyter`. For this reason, as of 2025, we recommend developing resources with `VSCode` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-vscode >}}, a general-purpose code editor but offering excellent features in `Python`, rather than with `Jupyter`. For more information on using notebooks in VSCode, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

::: {.callout-note}
Although we recommend developing resources with Vscode rather than with Jupyter, final users will be able to open your educational resources with Jupyter if they want to.
:::


![Example with `Jupyter` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-jupyter >}}](/pics/jupyter.png)

![Example with `VSCode` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-vscode >}}](/pics/vscode.png)


## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

In {{< fa brands r-project >}}, notebooks are not commonly used - even though they offer several features that are particularly valuable for educational purposes.

When designing {{< fa brands r-project >}}-based training materials, two main options are available, each with its own pros and cons:

1. **Providing access to an HTML website**
      + Advantages: Solutions to exercices can be hidden, interactive widgets can be used to offer hints or guide learners step by step, and the layout is optimized for reading.
      + Drawbacks: This is not an interactive environment—learners must open a separate RStudio session to try out the code, which can disrupt the flow of learning.

2. **Providing access to a Quarto Markdown (.qmd) file**
      + Advantages: Fully interactive—learners can run code directly within the environment, benefiting from live feedback and hands-on practice.
      + Drawbacks: All answers and code are visible by default, which may reduce engagement and exploratory effort from the learners.

Since the first option can become cumbersome - especially when learners need to copy and paste large blocks of code - it is generally recommended to use the second option in most cases. Providing direct access to a Quarto Markdown file helps minimize the risk of hard-to-reproduce errors that often arise when learners switch between an HTML tutorial and their R session.

![Exemple with RStudio](/pics/rstudio.png)

::: {.callout-caution}
## Why `learnr` Is Not Recommended

While `learnr` allows for the creation of interactive and advanced elements such as quizzes—making it well-suited for beginner tutorials—it has some important limitations.

First, it requires deployment on a Shiny server, which can be costly and complex to maintain. Additionally, in `learnr`, code cells do not share a global environment. This means variables and objects created in one chunk are not accessible in others, making it difficult to manage state or build on previous steps.

These restrictions limit the usefulness of `learnr` for more complex tutorials, where maintaining continuity and evolving context across the tutorial is essential.

:::: 


## Introducing `Quarto`  {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}} to create training resources

`Quarto` is an open source program for creating `Python` {{< fa brands python >}} and {{< fa brands r-project >}} reproducible tutorials. 
It makes it possible to mix seamlessly code and text in the same document and can handle many output formats, including html, pdf or notebook (.ipynb extension). `Quarto` is strongly recommended for the development of educational resources.

![](pics/quarto.png)

This tutorial assumes that educational resources and training material will be made available in two forms:

- `Quarto` websites, mixing text and code chunks;
- Interactive environment (see ☝️)


# A step-by-step tutorial

## Step 1: create a `Github` {{< fa brands github >}} repository from a template

### What are templates and why use them?

The very first step towards developing educational resources consists in creating a `Github` repository that will contain them all. We recommend that you use the templates developed specifically for the AIML4OS project. There are two different templates, depending on the language you want to use. They are both hosted on `{{< fa brands github >}}`: 

* {{< fa brands r-project >}}: [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-r)
* `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}: [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python).

These templates contain all what you need to produce resources that can be easily made available as websites or as interactive environments on the SSP Cloud. More precisely, these templates contain:

- a minimal `Quarto` website with graphical elements reflecting AIML4OS aesthetic;
- a minimal example of a `Quarto` document producing a Jupyter Notebook ({{< fa brands python >}} `Python` only);
- a minimal example of a `Quarto` document mixing Markdown text and `R` code ({{< fa brands r-project >}} only);
- what is needed to manage dependencies (what packages are needed to run the codes, and in which version);
- scripts for `Github Actions` workflow for automated deployment (don't be afraid, see below!).

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## If you are not AIML4OS member and follow this guide anyway

You can still use the templates - just remove the style components using AIML4OS aesthetic. 

:::

### How to use a template?

Here is what to do to re-use a template:

- Go to the `Github` {{< fa brands github >}} page of the chosen template;
- Click on the _"Use this template"_ button and then on _"Create a new repository"_ (see @fig-template);
![Use this template button on `Github`](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-76823/mw-1440/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.webp){#fig-template width=50% fig-align="center"}


- Choose carefully the owner and the name of the new repository:
  - _Owner_: by default the owner is the creator of the fork, but it may be preferable to choose a Github organization (for instance the `AIML4OS` organization);
  - _Name_: give the repository a meaningful name, for instance _"Intro_To_Deep_Learning"_ or _"Intro_To_Linear_Regression"_.

## Step 2: define your development configuration on the SSPCloud

<!-- get started with `Quarto`  {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}} -->

SSPCloud is not only useful to disseminate educational resources; it is also the right place to develop them. Doing so will facilitate resource dissemination as the environment used for training will be equivalent to the one used for development. In other words, we strongly recommend that you develop on SSPCloud because this will help a lot to make your educational resources reproducible.

Some elements of this development environment will be used to provide a ready-to-use configuration for learners. However, learners don't need to be familiar with the technical concepts behind them, as the pre-configured environments are there so that learners can concentrate on acquiring skills. 

### What is a configuration and why is it useful?

The best way to develop resources on the SSPCloud is to define your own development configuration. In technical terms, a configuration is just a service available on the SSPCloud (eg: `RStudio` or `VSCode`) with additional user-defined settings such as: the Github repository you want to work on, your Github credentials, the size of memory and number of CPU you want to use, the initialization script you want to run...

Defining a configuration has two advantage:

- it lets you define the technical environment you want to use for a specific project;
- you can resume working on your project at any time in only one click, and be sure that the technical environment remains exactly the same.

Your ready to use configurations are listed on the right side of the "My services" tab. To use a configuration, you just have to click on `Launch` (red rectangle). You can modify or delete an existing configuration by clicking on the contextual menu (green rectangle).

![](pics/SSPCloud4.png){width=600}


::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
Defining a configuration may seem complicated the first time you do it, but you will get used to it in no time.
:::

### How to define a configuration

Here is how to define a ready to use development configuration using the SSPCloud. A video version is proposed below the text.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab and click on "New Service";
- Choose Rstudio and click Launch;
- Customize the configuration by changing four settings:
  + In the "Friendly Name" field, choose a meaningful name (for instance `dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);   
  + In the "Repository" field of the "Git" tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: `https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);
  + In the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;
  + (optional) In the "Initialization scripts" tab, paste the URL of your init script (for instance: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-r/refs/heads/main/init.sh`);
- Click on Save configuration;
- Click on Launch;
- Open the Rstudio service;
- Rename the Rproj file with a meaningful name (for instance `Intro_To_Linear_Regression.Rproj`);
- Click on the Rproj file to open the RStudio project;
- Run `renv::restore()` (this may take a while);
- You're all set!

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab and click on "New Service";
- Choose `Vscode-python` and click `Launch`[^options-ide];
- Customize the configuration by changing four settings:
  + In the "Friendly Name" field, choose a meaningful name (for instance `dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);   
  + In the "Repository" field of the "Git" tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: `https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);
  + In the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;
  + In the "Initialization scripts" tab, paste this URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/refs/heads/main/init.sh`;
- Click on Save configuration;
- Click on Launch;
- Open the Vscode service;
- You're all set!

[^options-ide]: By default, this service includes a `Python` installation, but does not offer additional software such as `R`. For multi-language training, you can use the `Vscode-r-python-julia` service.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Video version

Here's a video summarizing these manual gestures for configuring the Python environment. Setting up the R environment is very similar. The values entered in the fields, in particular the initialization script, are those given in the example above: adapt these values to your needs.

```{=html}
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://zoom.us/clips/embed/wGjagl_4RIemXEN98xvARg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;"></iframe></div>
```

:::

### How to use an existing configuration

Once a configuration is defined, using it is very easy and very fast:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab;
- On the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;
- Open the Rstudio service;
- Click on the Rproj file to open the RStudio project;
- Run `renv::restore()` (this may take a while);
- You're all set!

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab;
- On the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;
- Open the VSCode service;
- You're all set!

:::

## Step 3: develop resources with Quarto

If you have created a repository from a template and defined a development configuration, developing resources basically means modifying and extending the minimal examples available in your repository.

::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## Git, git, git, git, git

__It is absolutely essential that you commit and push your changes on a regular basis__ (every 30 minutes or so), because your service (Rstudio or VScode) is not persistent, meaning that any changes that were pushed before closing the service are permanently lost.
:::

### Manage data (if needed)

Depending on your project, you might need to access some data, for instance to train a model. The simplest way to proceed is to upload your data on the S3 storage service of SSPCloud, and then download it from S3 into your service.

#### Upload data to S3

The simplest way to upload data to S3 is to use the graphical interface available on SSPCloud. To to so, click on "File Explorer" on the left hand and then on "My data".

![](pics/SSPCloud6.png){width=700}

You can upload a file by navigating clicking on "Upload file" (blue rectangle). You can also create a subfolder by clicking on "Create directory" (red rectangle).

![](pics/SSPCloud7.png){width=700}

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## Three remarks to keep in mind

- Choose carefully in which subfolder you upload your files, because moving files from one subfolder to another one on S3 is not very convenient.
- Remember that only __open data__ can be uploaded on S3.
- By default, only you can see the files upload in your bucket. If you want other people to access the data, __do not forget to make publicly available__ by clicking on the eye on the right hand side (green rectangle). Once again: no sensitive data!!

::::

#### Download data

Your scripts may require some data to run (for instance: training data for an algorithm). Here is a way to download data automatically:

- Adapt the `download_data.sh` file so that the data is downloaded to your folder of choice;
- Add this script as an initialization script in your configuration (see step 2).

To obtain the S3 path to your data, use the File Explorer to navigate and find the file you want. The S3 path of your file is simply the path of the folder available in the top right corner of the explorer (red rectangle) and the name of the file (blue rectangle). In the screenshot below, the path of the first file is then: `s3/oliviermeslin/data_SILC_PUF/data_SILC_d2013.parquet`.

![](pics/SSPCloud8.png){width=700}


### Developing educational content in Quarto format

Most of the resources you will develop will take the form of Quarto documents, that you will either provide to final users or compile to final outputs (for instance, websites or Jupyter notebooks). As a consequence, you must learn how to use Quarto. Fortunately, Quarto is easy to use, has an amazing documentation and there are plenty of resources online to help you.

To to get started with Quarto documents, there are three basic elements you should know about: the header, raw text with Markdown formatting, and code chunks. We strongly recommend that you refer to the [official Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and in particular to the [beginner Quarto tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

#### The header

Your Quarto document typically starts with a **YAML header** to define metadata such as author, title, and so on. Here is a simple example. You can also have a look at the headers of the Quarto files available in the templates.

~~~yaml
---
title: "My beautiful Quarto Report"
author: "Mickey mouse"
---
~~~

#### Raw text with Markdown formatting

A Quarto document contains blocks of text with Markdown formatting. See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for a detailed presentation of Markdown. Here is a short example:  

~~~markdown
This is text with *italics* and **bold**.

We can define lists and sublists :

- first element;
- second element;
    - first sub-element;
    - second sub-element.
~~~

This code will result in the following formatted text:

This is text with *italics* and **bold**.

We can define lists and sublists:

- first element;
- second element;
    - first sub-element;
    - second sub-element.

#### Code chunks

A Quarto document can also contain blocks of code inside **code chunks**, denoted with triple backticks and the language you use. Adding a name to each chunk is a good practice (`nice_code` in the example below). You can use [chunk options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html) to change the behavior of the chunk (for instance if you want to show some code without executing it). 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

````markdown
```{{r}}
#| label: nice_code
# Load packages
library(ggplot2)

# Plot mpg vs hp
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```
````

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

````markdown
```{{python}}
#| label: nice_code
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
````
:::



### Developing and previewing a website

The first kind of output you may want to produce is a static website, consisting in a series of html documents. Developing a website with the AIML4OS templates is very easy: you just have to write text and code chunks in the existing `qmd` files (`index.qmd` and `chapter1.qmd`). You can also extend the structure of the website by adding new Quarto documents (preferably in the `chapters` subdirectory). These new chapters must then be added to the structure of the website by modifying the `_quarto.yml` file in two places: in the `render` argument, and in the `contents` of the `sidebar` argument. Importantly, there is no difference between Python and `R` when developing a Quarto website.

It is often convenient to have a look at what this website looks like while developing it. You can preview your website from command line by executing:

```{.bash}
quarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then go to [https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services), open the README of the service you are using and click on the link to the external port.

::: {#fig-port5000 layout-ncol=2}

![](pics/SSPCloud3.png){width=400}

Accessing website preview
:::


:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## What to do if you can't access the website preview?

If you can't access the website preview because there is no link in the README, it is likely that you forgot to open port 5000 in your configuration. This is easily solved: 

- Close your RStudio/VSCode service (after committing and pushing all changes!);
- Modify your configuration: in the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000 and save this new configuration;
- Launch again your RStudio/VSCode service.
::::

### Developing interactive scripts

Depending on the resources you develop, it may make more sense to provide your learners with interactive environments rather than a static website, particularly if your resources contain exercises. Although the final outputs are quite different for `R` and Python (`Jupyter` notebooks for `Python`, Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`), these resources can nonetheless be developed using Quarto.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
__The function `install.packages()` must not be used anywhere in your resources__ because it is not the proper way to manage package requirements (see below for recommendations on dependency management).
::::

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

Depending on the resources you develop, it may make more sense to provide your learners with a Jupyter notebook rather than a static website, particularly if your resources contain exercises. The good news is that you can easily generate Jupyter notebooks from your Quarto source files: you just need to execute the following command in the command line, and the notebooks will be written in the `_site` folder.

```{.bash}
quarto render --to ipynb
```

:::


### Managing dependencies when developing resources

A major challenge in any data science project is to make sure that its codes can be re-run without error by someone working in a different environment (this is called __portability__). Various technical requirements must be met to ensure portability; one of them is to keep track of all packages needed to run the code (and of the exact version of each package!), so that a new user can reinstall them easily. This section explains how to manage these dependencies using the right tools.

The dependency management tool depends on the language you use:

- If you use `R`, we recommend that you use `renv`;
- If you use `Python`, we recommend that you use `uv`.


::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

`renv` is an R package that helps you manage the dependencies of each of your projects. It means that `renv` lets you keep track of what packages are needed to run your code, and in what exact version. More precisely, using `renv` adds two specific files to your project:

- The lockfile `renv.lock` records information about every package used in the project, so that these packages can be re-installed on a new machine;
- the `.Rprofile` project file. This file is run automatically every time you start `R` so that `renv` is used properly.

Here is how to use `renv`:

- The first step in using `renv` is to initiate the tracking of dependencies using `renv::init()`. __You do not need to do it if you use the `R` template__ because this was already done.
- When developing resources, you should regularly run `renv::snapshot()`. This command will analyze your `R` scripts, detects what packages are used, and updates the `renv.lock` file. Do not forget to commit and push the changes to the `renv.lock` file!
- When you start working on your project with a new service, you should run `renv::restore()`. This command will reinstall all the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
If you forget to update the `renv.lock` file, your Github Actions workflow are likely to fail, and you probably won't be able to execute your `R` script in a new RStudio service. Keep calm, here is the solution: just run `renv::snapshot()`, commit and push the changes to the `renv.lock` file. This should solve the problem.
:::

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) of `renv`.

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

`uv` is a fast Python package manager that helps you **track and manage dependencies per project**, similarly to `renv` for R. Using `uv`, you can ensure your project is reproducible, fast to install, and easy to deploy.

More precisely, using `uv` introduces the following files to your project:

- The `pyproject.toml` file defines your dependencies and project metadata;

- To start using `uv`, run:

  ```bash
  uv init
  ```

This creates a `pyproject.toml` for your project if it doesn’t exist yet. This file will be the central piece of the dependency management. 

- To add a package:

  ```bash
  uv add pandas
  ```

- To recreate your environment from scratch on a new machine (or new service):

  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```

This will install all packages exactly as specified in `uv.lock`. Finally, you need to change the command used to run your preview `quarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0` to be

```bash
uv run quarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

By that command, you say quarto to use your `uv` environment
:::




## Step 4: set up a Github pages website

__This step is optional__, depending on whether your resources include a website. You can skip this step if your resources consist only in interactive environments (Jupyter notebooks for `Python`, interactive Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`).

### What are Github Actions and Github pages and why are they useful?

If you are developing a website for educational purposes, you probably want to publish it online. If you perform the publication manually (building the website, then publishing it), you'll have to re-do this series of tasks every time you change your website. This is time-consuming, repetitive and boring. But fortunately, you can automate this process thanks to GitHub Actions and Github Pages:

- GitHub Actions is a tool built into GitHub that runs pre-defined tasks like testing, building, and deploying code when specific events occur in a repository. For instance, GitHub Actions may perform a series of task every time you push on the `main` branch of your repository, without you doing anything manually. 
- GitHub Pages is a another tool from Github that lets you publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository; it is often used for project documentation or personal portfolios.

The main message is: __by combining GitHub Actions with GitHub Pages, you can set things up so that every time you make changes to your repository, GitHub Actions automatically updates your website and publishes it on GitHub Pages.__ This will save you a lot of time!

### Create the `gh-pages` branch

When developing resources, you will most likely use the `main` branch. However, for `Github Actions` to work, you need an additional branch `gh-pages` used by Github to deploy websites. This one will be rewritten automatically by `Github` after every Github Actions workflow. However, you need to create it first. __This should be done only once.__ Quarto documentation gives this command to create that branch. __Be careful with that command, do not use before having done a first push on Github.__

```{.bash}
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
```

### Define a Github Actions workflow

You need to define a Github Actions workflow to automate output construction and deployment. A GHA workflow is a list of instructions (for instance: install `R`, install packages...) that are executed automatically every time a certain event happens (for instance every time you push on the main branch). A GHA workflow is defined using specific `yaml` scripts, located in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. The templates already contain standard workflows that you can use as a starting point. We recommend that you have a careful look at these workflows; comments were added so that they are easy to follow.

A few important remarks on automated deployment:

- The website is deployed at an URL that depends on the owner and the name of the repository: `https://{REPO_OWNER}.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/`.
- You can monitor Github Actions jobs in the "Actions" tab of the Github repository of your project. Do not be afraid if your jobs fail at first; getting Github Actions to work often requires some debugging.


## Step 5: make your interactive environments easily available on the SSP Cloud

__This step is optional__, depending on whether your resources include interactive environments (Jupyter notebooks for `Python`, interactive Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`). You can skip this step if your resources consist only in a Quarto website.

## Python users only: accessing the automatically built `Jupyter Notebook`

Up to now, we mostly focused on the production and the deployment of static content. A small precision need to be done for producing and giving access to Jupyter Notebooks. 

Regarding the production side, it is automatically done by the Github Actions file provided on the Python template. This line in `.github/worfklows/prod.yml` 

```yaml
# Step 4b: Render Quarto in uv virtual environment (HTML)
- name: Render in ipynb
  run: uv run quarto render --to ipynb
```

Notebooks are automatically made available through the website deployed via Github Actions. Their location on this site depends on the path of the qmd used to build them. For example, for the example python template, the notebook is accessible via [this link](https://inseefrlab.github.io/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/chapters/chapter1.ipynb). If you try to open it directly via the browser, you will get a raw file. The aim of the init script we're about to present is to use sspcloud to make this file usable.

### Create an initialization script to prepare your environment for trainees

Up to now, we have covered initiaization of the trainers' development environment.

However, while the pre-configuration of a development environment is practical but not essential when building educational resources, it is mandatory when making ready-to-use tutorials available to trainees. For this purpose, _templates_ offer an example to be edited. depending on the URL on which your resources are made available.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

We assume that the notebook to be recovered is available at <https://inseefrlab.github.io/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/chapters/chapter1.ipynb> (see above to understand how it was produced).

The script provided in the _template_, in the `sspcloud/init-trainees.sh` folder, proposes a model for retrieving and preconfiguring the environment for trainees on the sspcloud. Overall, the idea is to automatically perform the following steps for trainees:

- Retrieve and install the environment needed to run _notebook_. This is greatly facilitated by the use of `uv`.
- Download the notebooks to be opened by trainees.

By customizing this script, you should have a ready-to-use environment. To test that the edits you've made to this one work, you can open a terminal on VSCode and run it from the command line. If this test is successful, the script has a good chance of running in a blank environment and creating a customized environment for your training. The aim of the next section is to show you how. Don't forget to commit the modifications you made to that script otherwise, in the next step, trainees won't endup with your notebook ready to use in their environment.

### Create an auto launch URL

An interesting feature of SSPCloud is that you can make a whole training environment available through one URL link. For instance, you can provide trainees with an interactive environment that contains a Jupyter notebook, the data used by the notebook, all dependencies used by the notebook and sufficient resources to run the code, all in one click. To do so, just follow two steps:

- Define all aspects of the training environment using the usual interface. Here are the elements you will probably want to configure:

  - `Friendly Name`: do not forget to use a meaningful name ("Intro_To_Deep_Learning"), that will be more convenient for trainees;
  - `Resources`: choose the requests and limits that are well-suited for your use case. Some trial-and-error might be necessary here. However, __in most cases, you don't need to change the resources there__ because sspcloud is giving you large maximal resources that fit most needs. 
  - `Initialization scripts`: you can add here the URL to an initialization script (see below). 
  - `GIT`: In the "Repository" field, paste the URL of the repository containing the resources.

- Copy the link provided at the top of the interface by clicking on "Copy Auto Launch URL", and paste it wherever you want. Anyone with an SSPCloud account can access the content. Do not forget to test your link a few times to be sure it works!

Regarding the initialization script, previous section gave you indication on how to personnalize it. You must put the raw github url of the script. For instance, if your github repository follows the `Python` template (https://github.com/InseeFrLab/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python), the init script might be found on `sspcloud/init-trainees.sh` file. You must use the raw file available on Github. It is available by clicking on the raw button when opening the file on Github. The url should have a pattern similar to this one: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InseeFrLab/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/refs/heads/main/sspcloud/init-trainees.sh>.

### Create a launch button for your website (bonus)

Let's say you have done everything described before. Then you end up with a very long URL, let's say <https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=Python%20tutorial%20example&version=2.3.15&s3=region-79669f20&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FInseeFrLab%2FAIML4OS-template-quarto-python%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fsspcloud%2Finit-trainees.sh»&autoLaunch=true>. 

You can of course ask trainees to copy and paste this url, enter it in the search bar of their browser and launch the search to access the site. But it's more user-friendly to have a ready-to-use button. Just take this one for Python as a basis and replace it with your own quick launch URL:

```bash
<a href="URL_THERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-original-href="URL_THERE"><img src="https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/SSP%20Cloud-Lancer_avec_VSCode-blue?logo=vsc&amp;logoColor=white" alt="Onyxia"></a>
```

which, when formatted, will give a button like this

```{=html}
<a href="https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=Python%20tutorial%20example&version=2.3.15&s3=region-79669f20&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FInseeFrLab%2FAIML4OS-template-quarto-python%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fsspcloud%2Finit-trainees.sh»&autoLaunch=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-original-href="https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=Python%20tutorial%20example&version=2.3.15&s3=region-79669f20&init.personalInit=«https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FInseeFrLab%2FAIML4OS-template-quarto-python%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fsspcloud%2Finit-trainees.sh»&autoLaunch=true"><img src="https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/SSP%20Cloud-Lancer_avec_VSCode-blue?logo=vsc&amp;logoColor=white" alt="Onyxia"></a>
```


### Add your resources on the training webpage hosted on the SSP Cloud

to be completed

<!-- ## Make a ready to use link to your resources

Let's assume now you want learners to avoid copy-pasting code from your program to their sandbox environment. SSPCloud proposes a feature that enables to launch a ready to use sandbox with one click. This enables to start an environment that can be overloaded by some parameters that would make learners ready to start their learning experience.
