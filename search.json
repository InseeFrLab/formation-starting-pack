    "text": "2.1 Which interactive environment should you use ?\n\nPython \n\n\nJupyter notebooks1 offer an interactive interface that allows you to write Python code, test it, and see the result below the instruction rather than in a separate console. Jupyter notebooks are essential in the fields of data science and education and research because they greatly simplify exploration and experimentation.\nThey allow you to combine text in Markdown format (a lighter markup text format than HTML or \\(\\LaTeX\\)), Python code, and HTML code for visualizations and animations in a single document.\nInitially, Jupyter  was the only software offering these interactive features. Now, there are other ways to benefit from notebook advantages while having an IDE with more comprehensive features than Jupyter. For this reason, as of 2025, we recommend developing resources with VSCode , a general-purpose code editor but offering excellent features in Python, rather than with Jupyter. For more information on using notebooks in VSCode, refer to the official documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlthough we recommend developing resources with Vscode rather than with Jupyter, final users will be able to open your educational resources with Jupyter if they want to.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample with Jupyter \n\n\n\n\n\nExample with VSCode \n\n\n\n\nIn , notebooks are not commonly used - even though they offer several features that are particularly valuable for educational purposes.\nWhen designing -based training materials, two main options are available, each with its own pros and cons:\n\nProviding access to an HTML website\n\nAdvantages: Solutions to exercices can be hidden, interactive widgets can be used to offer hints or guide learners step by step, and the layout is optimized for reading.\nDrawbacks: This is not an interactive environment—learners must open a separate RStudio session to try out the code, which can disrupt the flow of learning.\n\nProviding access to a Quarto Markdown (.qmd) file\n\nAdvantages: Fully interactive—learners can run code directly within the environment, benefiting from live feedback and hands-on practice.\nDrawbacks: All answers and code are visible by default, which may reduce engagement and exploratory effort from the learners.\n\n\nSince the first option can become cumbersome - especially when learners need to copy and paste large blocks of code - it is generally recommended to use the second option in most cases. Providing direct access to a Quarto Markdown file helps minimize the risk of hard-to-reproduce errors that often arise when learners switch between an HTML tutorial and their R session.\n\n\n\nExemple with RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy learnr Is Not Recommended\n\n\n\nWhile learnr allows for the creation of interactive and advanced elements such as quizzes—making it well-suited for beginner tutorials—it has some important limitations.\nFirst, it requires deployment on a Shiny server, which can be costly and complex to maintain. Additionally, in learnr, code cells do not share a global environment. This means variables and objects created in one chunk are not accessible in others, making it difficult to manage state or build on previous steps.\nThese restrictions limit the usefulness of learnr for more complex tutorials, where maintaining continuity and evolving context across the tutorial is essential."

We recommend that you use the templates developed specifically for the AIML4OS project. There are two different templates, depending on the language you want to use. They are both hosted on :\n\n: template\nPython : template.\n\nThese templates contain all what you need to produce resources that can be easily made available as websites or as interactive environments on the SSP Cloud. More precisely, these templates contain:\n\na minimal Quarto website with graphical elements reflecting AIML4OS aesthetic;\na minimal example of a Quarto document producing a Jupyter Notebook ( Python only);\na minimal example of a Quarto document mixing Markdown text and R code ( only);\nwhat is needed to manage dependencies (what packages are needed to run the codes, and in which version);\nscripts for Github Actions workflow for automated deployment (don’t be afraid, see below!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not AIML4OS member and follow this guide anyway\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can still use the templates - just remove the style components using AIML4OS aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 How to use a template?\nHere is what to do to re-use a template:\n\nGo to the Github  page of the chosen template;\nClick on the “Use this template” button and then on “Create a new repository” (see ?@fig-template); \nChoose carefully the owner and the name of the new repository:\n\nOwner: by default the owner is the creator of the fork, but it may be preferable to choose a Github organization (for instance the AIML4OS organization);\nName: give the repository a meaningful name, for instance “Intro_To_Deep_Learning” or “Intro_To_Linear_Regression”."

    "text": "3.2 Step 2: define your development configuration on the SSPCloud\n\nSSPCloud is not only useful to disseminate educational resources; it is also the right place to develop them. Doing so will facilitate resource dissemination as the environment used for training will be equivalent to the one used for development. In other words, we strongly recommend that you develop on SSPCloud because this will help a lot to make your educational resources reproducible.\nSome elements of this development environment will be used to provide a ready-to-use configuration for learners. However, learners don’t need to be familiar with the technical concepts behind them, as the pre-configured environments are there so that learners can concentrate on acquiring skills.\n\n3.2.1 What is a configuration and why is it useful?\nThe best way to develop resources on the SSPCloud is to define your own development configuration. In technical terms, a configuration is just a service available on the SSPCloud (eg: RStudio or VSCode) with additional user-defined settings such as: the Github repository you want to work on, your Github credentials, the size of memory and number of CPU you want to use, the initialization script you want to run…\nDefining a configuration has two advantage:\n\nit lets you define the technical environment you want to use for a specific project;\nyou can resume working on your project at any time in only one click, and be sure that the technical environment remains exactly the same.\n\nYour ready to use configurations are listed on the right side of the “My services” tab. To use a configuration, you just have to click on Launch (red rectangle). You can modify or delete an existing configuration by clicking on the contextual menu (green rectangle).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining a configuration may seem complicated the first time you do it, but you will get used to it in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 How to define a configuration\nHere is how to define a ready to use development configuration using the SSPCloud. A video version is proposed below the text.\n\nPython \n\n\n\nGo the “My Services” Tab and click on “New Service”;\nChoose Rstudio and click Launch;\nCustomize the configuration by changing four settings:\n\nIn the “Friendly Name” field, choose a meaningful name (for instance dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression);\n\nIn the “Repository” field of the “Git” tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression);\nIn the “Network Access” tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;\n(optional) In the “Initialization scripts” tab, paste the URL of your init script (for instance: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InseeFrLab/AIML4OS-template-quarto-r/refs/heads/main/init.sh);\n\nClick on Save configuration;\nClick on Launch;\nOpen the Rstudio service;\nRename the Rproj file with a meaningful name (for instance Intro_To_Linear_Regression.Rproj);\nClick on the Rproj file to open the RStudio project;\nRun renv::restore() (this may take a while);\nYou’re all set!\n\n\n\n\nGo the “My Services” Tab and click on “New Service”;\nChoose Vscode-python and click Launch2;\nCustomize the configuration by changing four settings:\n\nIn the “Friendly Name” field, choose a meaningful name (for instance dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression);\n\nIn the “Repository” field of the “Git” tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression);\nIn the “Network Access” tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;\nIn the “Initialization scripts” tab, paste this URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InseeFrLab/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/refs/heads/main/init.sh;\n\nClick on Save configuration;\nClick on Launch;\nOpen the Vscode service;\nYou’re all set!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo version\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a video summarizing these manual gestures for configuring the Python environment. Setting up the R environment is very similar. The values entered in the fields, in particular the initialization script, are those given in the example above: adapt these values to your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 How to use an existing configuration\nOnce a configuration is defined, using it is very easy and very fast:\n\nPython \n\n\n\nGo the “My Services” Tab;\nOn the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;\nOpen the Rstudio service;\nClick on the Rproj file to open the RStudio project;\nRun renv::restore() (this may take a while);\nYou’re all set!\n\n\n\n\nGo the “My Services” Tab;\nOn the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;\nOpen the VSCode service;\nYou’re all set!"

    "text": "3.3 Step 3: develop resources with Quarto\nIf you have created a repository from a template and defined a development configuration, developing resources basically means modifying and extending the minimal examples available in your repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit, git, git, git, git\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely essential that you commit and push your changes on a regular basis (every 30 minutes or so), because your service (Rstudio or VScode) is not persistent, meaning that any changes that were pushed before closing the service are permanently lost.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Manage data (if needed)\nDepending on your project, you might need to access some data, for instance to train a model. The simplest way to proceed is to upload your data on the S3 storage service of SSPCloud, and then download it from S3 into your service.\n\n3.3.1.1 Upload data to S3\nThe simplest way to upload data to S3 is to use the graphical interface available on SSPCloud. To to so, click on “File Explorer” on the left hand and then on “My data”.\n\nYou can upload a file by navigating clicking on “Upload file” (blue rectangle). You can also create a subfolder by clicking on “Create directory” (red rectangle).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose carefully in which subfolder you upload your files, because moving files from one subfolder to another one on S3 is not very convenient.\nRemember that only open data can be uploaded on S3.\nIf you want other people to access the data, do not forget to make it public by clicking on the eye on the right hand side (green rectangle). Once again: no sensitive data!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Download data\nYour scripts may require some data to run (for instance: training data for an algorithm). Here is a way to download data automatically:\n\nAdapt the download_data.sh file so that the data is downloaded to your folder of choice;\nAdd this script as an initialization script in your configuration (see step 2).\n\nTo obtain the S3 path to your data, use the File Explorer to navigate and find the file you want. The S3 path of your file is simply the path of the folder available in the top right corner of the explorer (red rectangle) and the name of the file (blue rectangle). In the screenshot below, the path of the first file is then: s3/oliviermeslin/data_SILC_PUF/data_SILC_d2013.parquet.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Developing educational content in Quarto format\nMost of the resources you will develop will take the form of Quarto documents, that you will either provide to final users or compile to final outputs (for instance, websites or Jupyter notebooks). As a consequence, you must learn how to use Quarto. Fortunately, Quarto is easy to use, has an amazing documentation and there are plenty of resources online to help you.\nTo to get started with Quarto documents, there are three basic elements you should know about: the header, raw text with Markdown formatting, and code chunks. We strongly recommend that you refer to the official Quarto documentation and in particular to the beginner Quarto tutorial.\n\n3.3.2.1 The header\nYour Quarto document typically starts with a YAML header to define metadata such as author, title, and so on. Here is a simple example. You can also have a look at the headers of the Quarto files available in the templates.\n---\ntitle: \"My beautiful Quarto Report\"\nauthor: \"Mickey mouse\"\n---\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Raw text with Markdown formatting\nA Quarto document contains blocks of text with Markdown formatting. See here for a detailed presentation of Markdown. Here is a short example:\nThis is text with *italics* and **bold**.\n\nWe can define lists and sublists :\n\n- first element;\n- second element;\n    - first sub-element;\n    - second sub-element.\nThis code will result in the following formatted text:\nThis is text with italics and bold.\nWe can define lists and sublists:\n\nfirst element;\nsecond element;\n\nfirst sub-element;\nsecond sub-element.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2.3 Code chunks\nA Quarto document can also contain blocks of code inside code chunks, denoted with triple backticks and the language you use. Adding a name to each chunk is a good practice (nice_code in the example below). You can use chunk options to change the behavior of the chunk (for instance if you want to show some code without executing it).\n\nPython \n\n\n```{r nice_code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Plot mpg vs hp\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n\n```{python nice_code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Developing and previewing a website\nThe first kind of output you may want to produce is a static website, consisting in a series of html documents. Developing a website with the AIML4OS templates is very easy: you just have to write text and code chunks in the existing qmd files (index.qmd and chapter1.qmd). You can also extend the structure of the website by adding new Quarto documents (preferably in the chapters subdirectory). These new chapters must then be added to the structure of the website by modifying the _quarto.yml file in two places: in the render argument, and in the contents of the sidebar argument. Importantly, there is no difference between Python and R when developing a Quarto website.\nIt is often convenient to have a look at what this website looks like while developing it. You can preview your website from command line by executing:\nquarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0\nThen go to https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services, open the README of the service you are using and click on the link to the external port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Accessing website preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do if you can’t access the website preview?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can’t access the website preview because there is no link in the README, it is likely that you forgot to open port 5000 in your configuration. This is easily solved:\n\nClose your RStudio/VSCode service (after committing and pushing all changes!);\nModify your configuration: in the “Network Access” tab, enable access to your service through port 5000 and save this new configuration;\nLaunch again your RStudio/VSCode service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Developing interactive scripts\nDepending on the resources you develop, it may make more sense to provide your learners with interactive environments rather than a static website, particularly if your resources contain exercises. Although the final outputs are quite different for R and Python (Jupyter notebooks for Python, Quarto documents with R chunks for R), these resources can nonetheless be developed using Quarto.\n\nPython \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function install.packages() must not be used anywhere in your resources because it is not the proper way to manage package requirements (see below for recommendations on dependency management).\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the resources you develop, it may make more sense to provide your learners with a Jupyter notebook rather than a static website, particularly if your resources contain exercises. The good news is that you can easily generate Jupyter notebooks from your Quarto source files: you just need to execute the following command in the command line, and the notebooks will be written in the _site folder.\nquarto render --to ipynb\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Managing dependencies when developing resources\nA major challenge in any data science project is to make sure that its codes can be re-run without error by someone working in a different environment (this is called portability). Various technical requirements must be met to ensure portability; one of them is to keep track of all packages needed to run the code (and of the exact version of each package!), so that a new user can reinstall them easily. This section explains how to manage these dependencies using the right tools.\nThe dependency management tool depends on the language you use:\n\nIf you use R, we recommend that you use renv;\nIf you use Python, we recommend that you use uv.\n\n\nPython \n\n\nrenv is an R package that helps you manage the dependencies of each of your projects. It means that renv lets you keep track of what packages are needed to run your code, and in what exact version. More precisely, using renv adds two specific files to your project:\n\nThe lockfile renv.lock records information about every package used in the project, so that these packages can be re-installed on a new machine;\nthe .Rprofile project file. This file is run automatically every time you start R so that renv is used properly.\n\nHere is how to use renv:\n\nThe first step in using renv is to initiate the tracking of dependencies using renv::init(). You do not need to do it if you use the R template because this was already done.\nWhen developing resources, you should regularly run renv::snapshot(). This command will analyze your R scripts, detects what packages are used, and updates the renv.lock file. Do not forget to commit and push the changes to the renv.lock file!\nWhen you start working on your project with a new service, you should run renv::restore(). This command will reinstall all the packages listed in the renv.lock file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you forget to update the renv.lock file, your Github Actions workflow are likely to fail, and you probably won’t be able to execute your R script in a new RStudio service. Keep calm, here is the solution: just run renv::snapshot(), commit and push the changes to the renv.lock file. This should solve the problem.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the official documentation of renv.\n\n\nà compléter par Lino"

You can skip this step if your resources consist only in interactive environments (Jupyter notebooks for Python, interactive Quarto documents with R chunks for R).\n\n3.4.1 What are Github Actions and Github pages and why are they useful?\nIf you are developing a website for educational purposes, you probably want to publish it online. If you perform the publication manually (building the website, then publishing it), you’ll have to re-do this series of tasks every time you change your website. This is time-consuming, repetitive and boring. But fortunately, you can automate this process thanks to GitHub Actions and Github Pages:\n\nGitHub Actions is a tool built into GitHub that runs pre-defined tasks like testing, building, and deploying code when specific events occur in a repository. For instance, GitHub Actions may perform a series of task every time you push on the main branch of your repository, without you doing anything manually.\nGitHub Pages is a another tool from Github that lets you publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository; it is often used for project documentation or personal portfolios.\n\nThe main message is: by combining GitHub Actions with GitHub Pages, you can set things up so that every time you make changes to your repository, GitHub Actions automatically updates your website and publishes it on GitHub Pages. This will save you a lot of time!\n\n\n3.4.2 Create the gh-pages branch\nWhen developing resources, you will most likely use the main branch. However, for Github Actions to work, you need an additional branch gh-pages used by Github to deploy websites. This one will be rewritten automatically by Github after every Github Actions workflow. However, you need to create it first. This should be done only once. Quarto documentation gives this command to create that branch. Be careful with that command, do not use before having done a first push on Github.\ngit checkout --orphan gh-pages\ngit reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Initialising gh-pages branch\"\ngit push origin gh-pages\n\n\n3.4.3 Define a Github Actions workflow\nYou need to define a Github Actions workflow to automate output construction and deployment. A GHA workflow is a list of instructions (for instance: install R, install packages…) that are executed automatically every time a certain event happens (for instance every time you push on the main branch). A GHA workflow is defined using specific yaml scripts, located in the .github/workflows directory of your repository. The templates already contain standard workflows that you can use as a starting point. We recommend that you have a careful look at these workflows; comments were added so that they are easy to follow.\nA few important remarks on automated deployment:\n\nThe website is deployed at an URL that depends on the owner and the name of the repository: https://{REPO_OWNER}.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/.\nYou can monitor Github Actions jobs in the “Actions” tab of the Github repository of your project. Do not be afraid if your jobs fail at first; getting Github Actions to work often requires some debugging."
